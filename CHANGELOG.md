## [0.3.1] - 2026-08-29

Correctness and boundaries. No new capability; every item is a defect found by reading v0.3.0 against its own stated guarantees, each with a regression test.

Fixed: Wordlist paths locked to allowed roots (a model-supplied path was previously checked only for existence, and a wordlist is transmitted to the target line by line, so any readable file was an exfiltration channel). Brute-force correlation is now temporal — failures must precede the first success, so an admin who logs in then mistypes is no longer reported as a compromise. Unrecognised web log formats now say so loudly instead of reading as a clean result. Model-supplied regexes are bounded before matching. `shlex.join` for recorded commands, so the report shows what would reproduce. Pattern checks on `extensions` and `ports`. `safety.py` docstring corrected to name `searchsploit_lookup` as the local-only exception to the gate.

Tests: 37 new (77 total).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-22

Added: Blue-team threat-hunting agent (`hunt.py`) with read-only, path-locked log tools (`auth_summary`, `web_log_summary`, `search`, `read_lines`). Defensive MITRE ATT&CK mapping (`detections.py`). Bundled synthetic sample logs for demo/testing. `HuntReport` with severity-ranked findings table. 12 new tests (40 total).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-19

Added: `run_ffuf` (dir + vhost fuzzing), `run_dns_enum` (zone transfer + record lookups), `knowledge.py` (finding -> MITRE ATT&CK -> HTB Academy mapping), HTML reports alongside Markdown, structured `finish_session` with study pointers, pytest suite for `safety.py` (28 tests).
Changed: Model bumped to `claude-sonnet-5`. Gobuster accepts wordlist override. CI runs tests.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-13

Initial release: Claude-driven recon loop (nmap, whatweb, gobuster, searchsploit lookup), allowlist-gated, Markdown reports, CI with ruff + pip-audit.
